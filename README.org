* Description
  OpenFOAM uses some additional software for visualisation (ParaView), parallelisation
  (OpenMPI) and decomposition (options including Scotch/PtScotch, Zoltan, METIS/ParMETIS).
  By default, OpenFOAM is configured to use standard system installations of these packages,
  except for some packages (Scotch and Zoltan) whose source code is provided and automatically
  compiled, as described here: https://openfoam.org/download/source/third-party-software

  Users can optionally compile software packages rather than install system versions.  To do so,
  they need to download the source code of the relevant package(s) before running installation
  script(s).
* Downloading additional software
  Links to the source code of recommended versions of additional packages are listed below.  Any
  package selected should be downloaded and unpacked in the third-party directory (~ThirdParty-dev~).
