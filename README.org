* Description
  Scripts for building third-party packages.
* [[https://openfoam.org/download/source/third-party-software/][Download and installation instructions]]
* Order of execution:
  + makeGcc   (recommended if the system gcc is < 4.8)
  + Allwmake  (Builds OpenMPI, Scotch etc.)
  + makeCmake (if the system cmake version is < 3.3.0)
  + makeParaView
*** Optional
    + AllwmakeLibccmio (Only required for conversion of STAR-CCM+ meshes)
    + Allclean (Only required to save disk space)
* Versions and locations to download the third party packages
*** Gcc C++ Compiler
    The minimum version of gcc required is 4.8.0
    + gcc   https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html
    + gmp   https://gmplib.org/
            https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gmp/gmp-5.1.2.tar.bz2
    + mpfr  https://www.mpfr.org/
            https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mpfr/mpfr-3.1.2.tar.bz2
    + mpc   http://www.multiprecision.org/
            https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mpc/mpc-1.0.1.tar.gz
*** Parallel Processing
***** Scotch
      Scotch-6.0.9 is provided with ThirdParty-dev or the original source pack
      may be obtained from:
      + Scotch/PtScotch: https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/download.php/file/38187/scotch_6.0.9.tar.gz
***** OpenMPI
      + OpenMPI: https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v2.1/downloads/openmpi-2.1.1.tar.bz2
*** ParaView
    If the system cmake version is < 3.3.0 you will need to download and build a
    recent version:
    + cmake          https://www.cmake.org/files/v3.9/cmake-3.9.0.tar.gz
    + ParaView-5.6.3 http://www.paraview.org/files/v5.6/ParaView-v5.6.3.tar.gz
    is downloaded automatically and compiles without modification.  ParaView is
    compiled by running the =makeParaView= script, i.e.
    + ./makeParaView
    Expect ParaView to take a long time to compile, typically several hours on a
    desktop computer.  Following compilation, update the environment by sourcing
    the .bashrc (or .cshrc) file or by typing
    + wmRefresh
*** CGAL
    + CGAL        https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/releases/download/releases%2FCGAL-5.0.2/CGAL-5.0.2.tar.xz
    + boost       https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.72.0/boost_1_72_0.tar.bz2/download
