NAME
  mtst - test the consistency of source meshes

SYNOPSIS
  mtst [options] [mfile] [lfile]

DESCRIPTION
  The mtst program checks, in a sequential way, the consistency of a
  Scotch source mesh and, in case of success, outputs some statistics
  regarding edge weights, node and element vertex weights, and node
  and element vertex degrees.

  Source mesh file mfile can only be a centralized mesh file. The
  resulting statistics are stored in file lfile. When file names are
  not specified, data is read from standard input and written to
  standard output. Standard streams can also be explicitly
  represented by a dash '-'.

  When the proper libraries have been included at compile time, mtst
  can directly handle compressed meshes, both as input and output. A
  stream is treated as compressed whenever its name is postfixed with
  a compressed file extension, such as in 'brol.msh.bz2' or '-.gz'. The
  compression formats which can be supported are the bzip2 format
  ('.bz2'), the gzip format ('.gz'), and the lzma format ('.lzma').

OPTIONS
  -h          Display some help.

  -V          Display program version and copyright.

EXAMPLE
  Test the consistency of mesh brol.msh:

    $ mtst brol.msh
