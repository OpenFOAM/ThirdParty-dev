NAME
  atst - test the consistency of target architectures

SYNOPSIS
  atst [options] [afile] [lfile]

DESCRIPTION
  The atst program checks the consistency of a Scotch
  decomposition-defined target architecture and, in case of success,
  outputs some statistics regarding the number of target vertices and
  the length of paths linking them. Target architectures define the
  topology of the target graphs used by static mapping programs
  gmap(1) and dgmap(1).

  The resulting statistics are stored in file lfile. When file names
  are not specified, data is read from standard input and written to
  standard output. Standard streams can also be explicitly represented
  by a dash '-'.

  When the proper libraries have been included at compile time, atst
  can directly handle compressed files, both as input and output. A
  stream is treated as compressed whenever its name is postfixed with
  a compressed file extension, such as in 'brol.tgt.bz2' or '-.gz'. The
  compression formats which can be supported are the bzip2 format
  ('.bz2'), the gzip format ('.gz'), and the lzma format ('.lzma').

OPTIONS
  -h          Display some help.
