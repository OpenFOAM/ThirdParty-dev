NAME
  gomtst - compute statistics on sparse matrix orderings

SYNOPSIS
  gotst [options] [gfile] [ofile] [lfile]

DESCRIPTION
  The gotst program computes, in a sequential way, statistics on a
  sparse matrix ordering, such as fill-in, operation count, and
  separator tree parameters: minimum, maximum, average height and
  variance of its leaves.

  Source graph file gfile can only be a centralized graph file. File
  ofile represents the ordering of the symmetric sparse matrix the
  pattern of which is represented by gfile. The resulting statistics
  are stored in file lfile. When file names are not specified, data is
  read from standard input and written to standard output. Standard
  streams can also be explicitly represented by a dash '-'.

  When the proper libraries have been included at compile time, gtst
  can directly handle compressed graphs, both as input and output. A
  stream is treated as compressed whenever its name is postfixed with
  a compressed file extension, such as in 'brol.grf.bz2' or '-.gz'. The
  compression formats which can be supported are the bzip2 format
  ('.bz2'), the gzip format ('.gz'), and the lzma format ('.lzma').

  Since gotst performs sequentially the symbolic factorization of
  matrix gfile in order to compute fill-in and operation count
  numbers, this program can take a long time or even run out of memory,
  when applied to very large graphs.

OPTIONS
  -h          Display some help.

  -v          Do not account for vertex weights when computing factorization costs.

  -V          Display program version and copyright.

EXAMPLE
  Display statistics on ordering brol.ord of graph brol.grf:

    $ gotst brol.grf brol.ord
