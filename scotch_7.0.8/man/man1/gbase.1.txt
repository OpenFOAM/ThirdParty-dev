NAME
  gbase - sets the base value of a source graph

SYNOPSIS
  gbase [options] bval [igfile] [ogfile]

DESCRIPTION
  The gbase program allows one to set to bval the base value of a
  source graph, that is, the starting index used to number its
  vertices and edges. The base value can be set to 0 or 1, so that
  graphs can be easily imported from and/or exported to tools written
  in C or Fortran. Scotch can handle graphs irrespective of their base
  value.

  When the proper libraries have been included at compile time, gbase
  can directly handle compressed graphs, both as input and output. A
  stream is treated as compressed whenever its name is postfixed with
  a compressed file extension, such as in 'brol.grf.bz2' or '-.gz'. The
  compression formats which can be supported are the bzip2 format
  ('.bz2'), the gzip format ('.gz'), and the lzma format ('.lzma').

OPTIONS
  -h          Display some help.

  -V          Display program version and copyright.

EXAMPLE
  Set the base of graph 'brol.grf' to 1, and write the modified graph
  to file 'brol_b1.grf'.

    $ gbase 1 brol.grf brol_b1.grf
