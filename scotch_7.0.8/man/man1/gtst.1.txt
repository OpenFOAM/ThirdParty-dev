NAME
  gtst - test the consistency of source graphs

SYNOPSIS
  gtst [options] [gfile] [lfile]

DESCRIPTION
  The gtst program checks, in a sequential way, the consistency of a
  Scotch source graph and, in case of success, outputs some statistics
  regarding edge weights, vertex weights, and vertex degrees.

  It produces the very same results as the dgtst(1) program of the
  PT-Scotch parallel distribution, but unlike this latter it cannot
  handle distributed graphs.

  Source graph file gfile can only be a centralized graph file. The
  resulting statistics are stored in file lfile. When file names are
  not specified, data is read from standard input and written to
  standard output. Standard streams can also be explicitly
  represented by a dash '-'.

  When the proper libraries have been included at compile time, gtst
  can directly handle compressed graphs, both as input and output. A
  stream is treated as compressed whenever its name is postfixed with
  a compressed file extension, such as in 'brol.grf.bz2' or '-.gz'. The
  compression formats which can be supported are the bzip2 format
  ('.bz2'), the gzip format ('.gz'), and the lzma format ('.lzma').
