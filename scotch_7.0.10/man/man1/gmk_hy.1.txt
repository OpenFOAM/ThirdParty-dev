NAME
  gmk_hy, gmk_m2, gmk_m3, gmk_ub2 - create source graphs

SYNOPSIS
  gmk_hy [options] dim [ofile]

  gmk_m2 [options] [-gcfile] dimX dimY [ofile]

  gmk_m3 [options] [-gcfile] dimX dimY dimZ [ofile]

  gmk_ub2 [options] dim

DESCRIPTION
  The gmk_* programs create source graph files for some common,
  regular topologies.

  gmk_hy creates a hypercube of dimension dim.

  gmk_m2 creates a 2D regular grid of dimensions dimX and dimY.

  gmk_m3 creates a 3D regular grid of dimensions dimX, dimY and dimZ.

  gmk_ub2 creates an unoriented de Bruijn graph of dimension dim.

OPTIONS
  -b base     For gmk_m2 and gmk_m3 only. Output graphs with base
              value set to base. Default value is 0.

  -e          For gmk_m2 only. Build a 8-neighbor grid rather than a
              4-neighbor grid.

  -gcfile   For gmk_m2 and gmk_m3 only. Output graph vertex
              coordinates (that is, geometry data to be used by
	      gout(1)) in file cfile.

  -h          Display some help.

  -t          For gmk_m2 and gmk_m3 only. Create torus graphs, that
              is, graphs such that there exist loop edges between
	      vertices of rank 0 and (dim-1) in every dimension.

  -V          Display program version and copyright.

EXAMPLE
  Create a 5x7 grid along with its geometry:

    $ gmk_m2 5 7 -g/tmp/m5x7.xyz /tmp/m5x7.grf
