NAME
  gmk_m2, gmk_m3 - create 2D and 3D grid source graphs

SYNOPSIS
  gmk_m2 [options] [-bbval] [-gcfile] [-t] [-y] dimX dimY [ofile]

  gmk_m3 [options] [-bbval] [-gcfile] [-t] [-y] dimX dimY dimZ [ofile]

DESCRIPTION
  The gmk_* programs create source graph files for some common,
  regular topologies.

  gmk_m2 creates a 2D regular grid graph of dimX times dimY vertices,
  such that vertex (i,j) is connected to vertices (i,j-1), (i-1,j),
  (i+1,j) and (i,j+1), if they exist. If the -e option is set, it is
  additionally connected to vertices (i-1,j-1), (i+1,j-1),
  (i-1,j+1) and (i+1,j+1), if they exist.

  gmk_m3 creates a 3D regular grid graph of dimX times dimY times dimZ
  vertices, such that vertex (i,j,k) is connected to vertices
  (i,j,k-1), (i,j-1,k), (i-1,j,k), (i+1,j,k), (i,j+1,k) and (i,j,k+1),
  if they exist.

OPTIONS
  -bbval   Set the base value of the graph to bval. Default base value is 0.
  -e         Build a 8-neighbor grid rather than a 4-neighbor one (for
             gmk_m2 only).
  -gcfile  Output graph vertex coordinates (that is, geometry data to be used by
	     gout) in file cfile.
  -h         Display some help.
  -t         Builds a torus rather than a grid.
  -V         Display program version and copyright.
  -y         Invert y coordinate in geometry.

EXAMPLE
  Create a 2D graph of 5x7 vertices, of base 1, along with its geometry:

    $ gmk_m2 5 7 -b1 -g/tmp/m5x7.xyz /tmp/m5x7.grf
