NAME
  mcv - mesh file converter

SYNOPSIS
  mcv [options] [imfile] [omfile] [oxfile]

DESCRIPTION
  The mcv program converts Scotch mesh files from and to other
  external file formats.

  File imfile is converted into mesh file omfile, with optional
  geometry data being put in geometry file oxfile, if it is
  available.

  When file names are not specified, data is read from standard input
  and written to standard output. Standard streams can also be
  explicitly represented by a dash '-'.

  When the proper libraries have been included at compile time, mcv
  can directly handle compressed meshes, both as input and output. A
  stream is treated as compressed whenever its name is postfixed with
  a compressed file extension, such as in 'brol.msh.bz2' or '-.gz'. The
  compression formats which can be supported are the bzip2 format
  ('.bz2'), the gzip format ('.gz'), and the lzma format ('.lzma').

OPTIONS
  -h          Display some help.

  -iifmt    Set format of input mesh file, which can be:
              bnum  Boeing-Harwell format. This is an elemental
                      matrix format. Only square matrices are supported. In
                      case the file contains several matrices, the num
                      parameter allow the user to provide the index of
                      the matrix to convert, starting from 0. When the num
                      parameter is not set, it is assumed to be 0.
              s       Scotch mesh format.

  -oofmt    Set format of output mesh file, which can be:
              s  Scotch mesh format. This is the only possible choice at
                 the time being.
 
  -V          Display program version and copyright.

EXAMPLE
  Convert a Harwell-Boeing elemental mesh into a Scotch mesh.

    $ mcv -ib brol.hb brol.msh
