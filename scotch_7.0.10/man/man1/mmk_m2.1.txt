NAME
  mmk_m2, mmk_m3 - create source meshes

SYNOPSIS
  mmk_m2 [options] [-gcfile] dimX dimY [ofile]

  mmk_m3 [options] [-gcfile] dimX dimY dimZ [ofile]

DESCRIPTION
  The mmk_* programs create source mesh files for some common,
  regular topologies.

  mmk_m2 creates a 2D regular grid mesh of dimX times dimY elements
  and (dimX+1) times (dimY+1) nodes, such that element (i,j) is
  connected to nodes (i,j), (i,j+1), (i+1,j) and (i+1,j+1).

  mmk_m3 creates a 3D regular grid mesh of dimX times dimY times dimZ
  elements and (dimX+1) times (dimY+1) times (dimZ+1) nodes, such that
  element (i,j,k) is connected to nodes (i,j,k), (i,j,k+1), (i,j+1,k),
  (i,j+1,k+1), (i+1,j,k), (i+1,j,k+1), (i+1,j+1,k) and (i+1,j+1,k+1).

OPTIONS
  -gcfile  Output graph vertex coordinates (that is, geometry data to be used by
	     gout(1)) in file cfile.
  -h         Display some help.
  -V         Display program version and copyright.

EXAMPLE
  Create a mesh of 5x7 elements, along with its geometry:

    $ mmk_m2 5 7 -g/tmp/m5x7.xyz /tmp/m5x7.msh
